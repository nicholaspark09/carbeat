## What does this app do?
  This app was created for me to mess around with Kotlin, LifecycleFragments, LiveData, and Room. Basically I'd like to use this as a sort of testing ground.
  
## Who can fork it?
  Everyone. Fork it, use it, and abuse it. 
  
## Unit Tests
  I'm trying to do this app using TDD or Test Driven Development. I feel it's one of the best practices in coding and like the work Google has done in promoting it.
